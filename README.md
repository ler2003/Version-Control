# Why we chose liscense and code of conduct:
We chose that code of conduct in order to emphasize inclusion and prevent harrasment. We felt this code of conduct accurately displays our beliefs about diverysity, equality, and respect. We chose the liscense to help our software reach as wide as possible by waiving copyright interests. We have decided to do this in order to best help contribute to scientific work everywhere. We hope these choices enable a positive environment to freeely incorporate, reuse, and redistribute our work to constribute to "Commons".
